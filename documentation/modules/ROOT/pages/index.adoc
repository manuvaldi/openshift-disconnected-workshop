= Welcome to Openshift Disconnected Workshop
:page-layout: home
:!sectids:

Openshift 4 supports disconnected installations. But some components need to be configured on day 2 to give the same service as a connected Cluster.

In this workshop you'll learn about:

* Different types of mirroring Openshift images
* Disconnect a cluster
* Upgrade a cluster in a disconnected environment
* Ways of getting available Operators and their images 
* Deploy a disconnected cluster
* Upload of Insight and Telemeter information to the cloud
* Mirror of Openshift Samples Operator images
* Deploy our own Openshift Update Service
