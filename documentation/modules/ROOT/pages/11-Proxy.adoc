include::_attributes.adoc[]

The way of connect a disconnected cluster included images, telemetry and insights, may be via:

. Routing. Probably a firewall manage which connection are allowed
. Proxy or Proxy filtering

To configure a proxy in a cluster you will edit the proxy object:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Proxy
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  httpProxy: http://registry.dsal:3128
  httpsProxy: http://registry.dsal:3128
  noProxy: registry.dsal
  readinessEndpoints:
  - http://www.google.com
  - https://www.google.com
  trustedCA:
    name: user-ca-bundle
----

Remember that if you have a cluster with proxy, the images can be downloaded with it, so we don't need the ImageContentSourcePolicy neither disable Default catalogs.
